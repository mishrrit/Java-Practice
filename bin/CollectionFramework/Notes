List:
1. Order based collection
2. Index based

ArrayList
Dynamic list
LinkedList
DynamicArray

Set
No Duplicates

Queue:
FIFO

Map
key: value 

Iterator
iterates over an element from collection



Advantage of Collection Framework

1. Reduces Programming effort
2. Provide built in methods and classes
3. Increase productivity
4. Reduce Operational Time
5. inter-operablity


Common Methods
1. add
2. addall
3. remove
4. removeall
5. size()
6. clear()
7. contains()
8. containsall()
9. retain()
10. retainall()


Common Exceptions
1. Null POinter Exceptions
2. Classcast Exceptions
3. Illegal Argument Exception
4. Illegal State Exceptions
5. UnsupportedOperationException



ThreadSafe:
When multiple threads are trying to access the same piece of data and the value of the data is getting changed, 
this is not thread-safe and will get inconsistent result

Async - multi thread at a time
Sync- single thread a time

HashMap
HashCode is used as Internal mechanism  and work as a linked list
HashCode for Null keys are always 0

------------------------
HashTable       vs       HashMap     vs      SynchronizedMap vs      ConcurrentHashmap
not thread safe			thread safe				thread safe				thread safe
one null key			no null key			null key allowed		null key allowed
multiple null values	not allowed			  allowed						allowed


Concurrent hashMap after java 1.5 - best for performance
create segments of size 16, multiple thread can access one of the segments at a time, not the one which is locked by thread1
